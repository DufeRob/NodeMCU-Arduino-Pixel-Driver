# PxlNode (UDP + SERIAL)

The PxlNode family of code, has been designed with the goal of making it easier than ever to stream pixel data in real time to your leds from [GeoPix](http://www.geopix.io). GeoPix has native support for these protocols, not only streaming but polling and configuration making it very easy to import and pixel map with out any more hassle than neccesary.

If you are interested in using this code base with other software, the protocol is entirely documented and fairly straight forwards to grasp.

For a complete guide, and breakdown of both Teensy and NodeMCU code bases, please refer to the complete [WIKI](https://github.com/EnviralDesign/NodeMCU-Arduino-Pixel-Driver/wiki).
